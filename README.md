This is my Master Thesis about Geometric Stacks in [Synthetic Algebraic Geometry](https://github.com/felixwellen/synthetic-zariski), under the supervision of Floris van Doorn and Hugo Moeneclay. 
Have a look at a [short summary](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timlichtnau/MasterThesis/Main/MasterThesisSummary.pdf) from October 2024. 
The current work in progress of the full thesis is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timlichtnau/MasterThesis/Main/main.pdf).
