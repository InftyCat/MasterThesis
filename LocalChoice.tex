In this section let $\bT$ denote a topology finer than the zariski topology.
\begin{definition}
	Let \Cov be a class of morphisms (which we think of $n$-atlasses of some $n$), containing $\bT$-atlas, (stable under pullback NECESSARY TODO?)
	A type $S$ has \emph{local choice} wrt \Cov if for any $\bT$ -surjective map $X \to Y$ and any map $f : S \to Y$ there exists a map  $p' : S' \to S$ in \Cov and a commutative diagram

	%We say $S$ has affine local choice, if one can arrange $S'$ to be affine.
\end{definition}
\begin{prop}{\label{prop:LocalChoice}}
	%Let $\bT$ be a finer topology than the zariski topology.
	Assume that \Cov is stable under composition. %and that Zariski-covers are in \Cov.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If $\hat S \to S$ is a \Cover and $\hat S$ has $\bT$-local choice, then $S$ has $\bT$-local choice. 
		\item Affine schemes have $\bT$-local choice.
		\item Any type admitting a \Cov - Atlas $\Spec A \to S$ has $\bT$-local choice.
	\end{itemize}
%	$S$ has  $\bT$-local choice wrt \Cov if it has a projective \Cover, i.e. there exists a projective (or, assuming ZLC, affine scheme resp.)  $\hat{S}$ with a map $g : \hat{S} \to S$ in \Cov. %, satisfying local choice wrt \Cov
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	%We may assume that $f = \id_S$.
	The first point follows from stability under composition of \Cov. %  We may assume that $g : \hat{S} \to S$ is the identity.
	the third point follows from the second. 
	By the first point, we may assume that $S$ is affine.
	As $p$ is $\bT$-surjective, for any $x : S$ there merely is a $\Spec B_x \in T$  and a map $\Spec B_x \to \| \fib_p (x) \| $. 
	%Claim: No matter on the assumptions (on $S = \hat{S}$), there exists a Zariski cover $S' \overset{p'}{\to} S$ with $S'$ projective (affine resp.) 
	As $S$ is projective, we have a term in
	\[\prod_{x : S} \sum_{\Spec B_x \in T} \Spec B_x \to \| \fib_p (f x)\| \]
	%	Proof: In the case of projectivity, just use $p' = \id_S$ and in the case of having ZLC and $S$ beeing affine, use ZLC (\ref{ZLCGivesZariski}). \qed(Claim)\\    
	By setting 
	\[(S' := \sum_{x : S} \Spec B_x) \overset{\pi}{\longrightarrow} S \]
	
	the projection, we are now in the situation that for any $t : S'$ we merely have a point in $\fib_p((p'(t)))$ and $S' \to S$ is a $\bT$-cover, thus it is in \Cov. Moreover, $S'$ is affine, as it is a dependent sum of affines. Hence again we now can find a lift $S' \to X$ %By replacing $S''$ again with a Zariski cover we find a lift $S'' \to X$

The next lemma shows, that the class of types equipped with a $\bT$-atlas is stable under dependent sums.
\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:AtlasSum}}
	Let $\cU' \subset \cU$ be stable under dependent sums (e.g. $\bT$-inhabited types)
	Let $X$ be a type with a  map $p : U \to X$ fibered in $\cU'$.  For any $x : X$, let $Y_x$ be a type and moreover for any $u : U$, we are given a map $q_u : V_u \to Y_{p(u)}$ fibered in $\cU'$. Then the induced map
	\[
	p : \sum_{u : U} V_u \to \sum_{x : X} Y_{x}
	\]
	is fibered in $\cU'$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The fiber of $p$ over some $(x,y) \in \sum_{x :X} Y_x$ is given by
	\[
	\sum_{u : \fib_p x} \fib_{q_u} (y') 
	\]
	where $y' : Y_{p(u)}$ (depending on $u$) is the transport of $y : Y_x$ along $x = p(u)$. As $\cU'$ is stable under dependent sum %(\ref{lemma:LexSumStable}, \ref{lemma:LexStability}), 
	those fibers are again in $\cU'$. This shows the result.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}{\label{thm:atlasStableSum}}
	Let $\cU'$ be a class stable under dependent sums.
	The class of types admitting a $\cU'$-atlas is closed under dependent sums. If $\bT$ is a topology, the same holds for $\cU'$-atlasses with domain in $\bT$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	Let us construct some atlas $\Spec A \to \sum_{x : X} B_x$ %fibered in smooth $n$-stacks.
	For any $x : X$ we merely have an atlas $V_x \to B_x$, i.e. with $V_x$ affine. %fibered in smooth $n$-stacks . \\
	$X$ has local choice wrt atlasses by (\ref{prop:LocalChoice}) using $\cU'$ is $\sum$-stable (we use the trivial topology).\\
	If additionally, all the $B_x$ and $X$ are smooth $n$-stacks, just observe that we can choose the affine $V_{p u}$ to lie in $\bT$, Accordingly $\sum_{u : U} V_{p u} \in T$ as $\bT$ is stable under $\Sigma$.

%	$n$-atlasses contain zariski-atlasses, because $\bT$ is finer than the Zariski topology.
%	$\cU' are stable under dependent sum by induction, thus $n$-atlasses are stable under composition.         
%	\qed(Claim)\\
	By Local choice for $X$, we merely find $U$ affine, an atlas $p : U \to X$ % fibered in smooth $n$-stacks 
	with
	\[
	\prod_{u : U} \sum_{V_{p(u)} \in T} (q : V_{p(u)} \to B_{p(u)}) \times (q \ \text{fibered in smooth } n \text{ stacks } )
	\]
	Now the desired map is $\sum_{u : U} V_{p u} \to \sum_{x : X} B_x$, because it is  an atlas %fibered in smooth $(n)$-stacks 
	by \ref{lemma:AtlasSum} \\
