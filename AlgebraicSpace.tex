\subsection{Algebraic spaces}


%Let us also mention what we learned in the proof:
%\begin{lemma}[NECESSARY?@Â²]
%	A covering equivalence relation $R : S^2 \to \bT \Prop$ has values in geometric propositions.
%\end{lemma}

%\begin{corollary}
%	The identity types of algebraic spaces are geometric propositions.
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}
%	By the previous lemma and \ref{lemma:geometricStacksClosedUnderId}
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:detectGeomProp}}
%	Let $P$ be a sheaf and a proposition that admits a map $\Spec A \to P$ fibered in covering algebraic spaces. Then $P$ is a geometric proposition.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	The fibers are covering algebraic spaces and affine, hence covering affine. By \ref{def:algprop} we conclude.
%\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $X$ be a modal set. The following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X$ is a (covering) geometric 0-stack
		\item $X$ is merely of the form $L_\bT (U / R)$ for some (covering) affine $U$ and  $R : U^2 \to \Prop_{\ci}$ a covering equivalence relation. 
		\item there exists some map $S \to X$ with $S$ (covering) affine whose fibers merely have $\bT$-catlasses.
	\end{enumerate}
	We call this class (covering) algebraic spaces.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\ 	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [2 $\leftrightarrow$ 3]
		This is \ref {lemma:fundamental-property-algebraic-spaces}
	\item [2 $\to$ 1]
	Choose a presentation $ R: U^2 \to \Prop$.
	It suffices to show, that the map $f : U \to L_\bT ( U / R)$ is a geometric (c)atlas. The map $f$ is $\bT$-surjective by the well-definedness of the bijection $\ref{quotient-by-equivalence-relation}$. By descent we may just show, that the fibers $\fib_f (f(s))$ for $s : U$ are covering 0-stacks. But by the bijection in \ref{quotient-by-equivalence-relation} those are equivalent to the fibers $R_s$, which are covering 0-stacks as the equivalence relation is covering. \\
	\item [1 $\to$ 2]
	This can be reformulated in the following way, using the recursion principle for (covering) geometric 0-stacks:
	Let $X$ be a sheaf of sets. Let $S$ be (covering-) affine and $f : S \to X$ be fibered in covering algebraic spaces. Then $X$ is a (covering) algebraic space.
%	The identity types of $X$ admit a map fibered in covering algebraic spaces (todo check stability under $\sum$) out of an affine by \ref{lemma:havingAbstractAtlasClosedUnderId}. by \ref{lemma:detectGeomProp} they are geometric propositions. 
This follows from the observation, that the equivalence relation determined by $f$ is covering \ref{def:coveringEqRel} , because the fibers of $f$ are covering 0-stacks.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
	For any $n \ge 1$, we have inclusions 
	\[W_{n} \subset \CS_{n-1} \subset W_{n+1}\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Induction. $n = 1$ gives
	\[
	\mathsf{HasCatlas}_\bT \subset \CS_0 \subset \text{ types admitting a catlas fibered in } W_1
	\]
	the latter inclusion is the previous theorem. \\
	The induction step is obtained by \ref{prop:nstack}
\end{proof}
\subsection{Schemes are algebraic Spaces for the Zariski Topology}
\begin{definition}
 A proposition $U$ is open iff its merely of the form $f_1 \ inv \lor \hdots f_n inv$ for some $f_i : R$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Given $f_1, \hdots,f_n : R$ such that $\| D(f_1) + \hdots + D(f_n) \|$ then $\sum_{i=1}^n D(f_i) \in \Zar$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{prop}
	Every Zariski-merely-inhabited type that is merely of the form $U_1 + \hdots + U_n$ for open propositions $U_i$ admits a $\Zar$-catlas.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	By definition of openness, We can choose a surjection $\coprod_{j=1}^{n_i} D(f_{ij}) \twoheadrightarrow U_i$ for any $i$. We want to show, that the map
	\[
	\coprod_{i , j} D(f_{ij}) \twoheadrightarrow U_1 + \hdots U_n
	\]
	is a $\Zar$-catlas. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let us first show that the fibers are in $\Zar$. Assume $U_i$ holds. So we find a term in $\coprod_j D(f_{ij})$. In particular we have $\| \coprod_j D(f_{ij})\|_{\Zar}$. By the lemma we conclude, that the fiber $\sum_j D(f_{ij})$ belongs to $\Zar$.\\
		\item The total space is in $\Zar$: This follows as the surjection after propositional truncation becomes an equivalence. As we have $\| U_1 + \hdots + U_n\|$, we can conclude by the lemma.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{proof}
\begin{warning}
	The converse does not hold! We want to apply \ref{lemma:stackificationHasTCover}, to the map
	\[\Zar \ni 1 + 1 \to \sum D(f) \]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	$\sum D(f)$ is seperated as $D(f)$ is a sheaf.
		\item 	All the fibers are equivalent to $1 + X$, hence they are in the Zariski topology.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{warning}
\begin{lemma}
	let $X$ be a scheme. There merely exists some affine $S$  map $S \to X$ whose fibers are merely inhabited finite sums of open propositions 
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}		
		Every scheme is an algebraic space.
\end{corollary}
\begin{question}
	Is every algebraic space for the zariski topology a scheme?
\end{question}
\begin{rmk}
	The following example does not work: Let $p \neq 0$ be a prime. You can let $\mu_p := \Spec(R[X] / (X^p - 1))$ act on $\bA^\times$ via multiplication. Set $\bT= fppf$. Then the $p$.th power map

	\[
	pow : \| \bA^\times / \mu_p \|_0^\bT \to \bA^\times
	\]
	is an equivalence.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	 It is an embedding: 
		First note, that $\|\bA^\times / \mu_p \|_0$ is $\bT$-seperated:
		as $\mu_p$ act freely on $\bA^\times$, meaning that the identity types of the quotient are $\sum_{g: \mu_p g x =_{\bA^\times} y}$ , hence sheaves. \\
		On the other hand the map $\|\bA^\times / \mu_p \|_0 \to \bA^\times$ is an embedding, as for any $x , y : \bA^\times$ the map $(\sum_{g : \mu_p} g x = y) \to (x^p = y^p$ is an equivalence. 
		\item 	It is $\bT$-surjective, as for any $\lambda : \bA^\times$, we find $S = \Spec R [X] / (X^p - \lambda) \in \bT$ with 
		\[
		S \to \fib_{\bA^\times / \mu_p \to \bA^\times}(\lambda)
		\]
		hence 
		\[
		1 = \|S\|_\bT \to \|\fib_{pow}\|_0^\bT
		\]
	\end{itemize}


\end{rmk}

\begin{lemma}
	If $X$ is an algebraic space, then the global sections embed via a $R$-algebra homomorphisms into a finitely presented $R$-algebra.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Choose an atlas $S \to X$, in particular $\bT$-surjective. As $\bT$ is subcanonical the map $R^X \to R^S$ is an injection.
\end{proof}
\begin{question}
	Is it an open embedding of types?
\end{question}
%\begin{lemma}
%	Consider a morphism $X \to Y$ between algebraic spaces such that $R^F$ is finitely presented and the affinizations of the fibers $F \to \Spec R^F$ are open immersions. If $Y$ is a scheme, then $X$ is a scheme.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	Consider the stein factorization
%	\[
%	X = \sum_{y : Y} \fib_f y \to \sum_{y : Y} \Spec R^{\fib_f y} \to Y
%	\]
%	The first map 
%\end{proof}
\section{Group quotients}
For this section let $G$ denote a group that is a covering 0-stack. Let $X$ be a sheaf equipped with a $G$ action.
\begin{definition}
	A $G$ action on $X$ is free, if for all $x , y : X$ the type 
	\[
	\sum_{g: G} g x = y
	\]
	is a proposition. 
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ act freely on a sheaf $X$. Then the relation
	\[
	x , y\mapsto \sum_{g : G} g x = y
	\]
	is a covering equivalence relation on $X$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	All those propositions are modal as $X$ and $G$ are sheaves. For all $x : X$ , the fiber
	\[
	\sum_{y : X} \sum_{g : G} g x = y \simeq \sum_{g : G} \sum_{y: X} g x = y \simeq G
	\]
	is a covering 0-stack by assumption.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:algSpacesStabFreeQuots}}
	%For $n \ge 0$, geometric $(n)$-stacks 
	Algebraic spaces are stable by free quotients of covering group 0-stacks.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The map $ X \to L_T (X / G)$ is fibered in covering 0-stacks, so in particular covering $0$-stacks. As $X$ is a geometric $0$-stack, the quotient is a geometric $0$-stack as well, This follows by the description in \label{prop:nstack}, choosing a geometric atlas of $X$ and postcomposing this to get a geometric atlas of the quotient.
\end{proof}

%\begin{lemma}
%	Let $X$ be a geometric stack, whose identity types are covering stacks. Let $G$ be a finite group acting on $X$. Then $L_\bT (X / G)$ is a geometric stack.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	Consider for $x , y : X$ , $R(x,y) \equiv \| \sum_{g : G} g x = y\|_\bT$ which is indeed modal. We have to check that the relation is covering, i.e. that for all $x : X$, 
%	\[
%	\sum_{y: X} \|\sum_{g: G} g x = y\|_\bT
%	\]
%	is a covering stack. \\
%	To prove this, as covering stacks are stable under quotients, it suffices to show, that the map
%	\[
%	G \simeq \left (\sum_{y : X} \sum_{g : G} g x = y \right) \to \sum_{y: X} \|\sum_{g: G} g x = y\|_\bT
%	\]
%	is a geometric cover. But the fibers look like $\sum_{g : G} gx  = y$ which is a finite sum of identity types in $X$, which were assumed to be covering stacks. By \ref{lemma:geomStackPlusStable} the fibers are covering stacks.
%	
%\end{proof}
