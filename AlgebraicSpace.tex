%Let us also mention what we learned in the proof:
%\begin{lemma}[NECESSARY?@Â²]
%	A covering equivalence relation $R : S^2 \to \bT \Prop$ has values in geometric propositions.
%\end{lemma}

%\begin{corollary}
%	The identity types of algebraic spaces are geometric propositions.
%\end{corollary}
%\begin{proof}
%	By the previous lemma and \ref{lemma:geometricStacksClosedUnderId}
%\end{proof}
%
%\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:detectGeomProp}}
%	Let $P$ be a sheaf and a proposition that admits a map $\Spec A \to P$ fibered in covering algebraic spaces. Then $P$ is a geometric proposition.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	The fibers are covering algebraic spaces and affine, hence covering affine. By \ref{def:algprop} we conclude.
%\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}
	Let $X$ be a modal set. The following are equivalent:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $X$ is a (covering) geometric 0-stack
		\item $X$ is merely of the form $L_\bT (U / R)$ for some (covering) affine $U$ and  $R : U^2 \to \Prop_{\ci}$ a covering equivalence relation. 
		\item there exists some map $S \to X$ with $S$ (covering) affine whose fibers merely have $\bT$-catlasses.
	\end{enumerate}
	We call this class (covering) algebraic spaces.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
\ 	\begin{enumerate}
	\item [2 $\leftrightarrow$ 3]
		This is \ref {lemma:fundamental-property-algebraic-spaces}
	\item [2 $\to$ 1]
	Choose a presentation $ R: U^2 \to \Prop$.
	It suffices to show, that the map $f : U \to L_\bT ( U / R)$ is a geometric (c)atlas. The map $f$ is $\bT$-surjective by the well-definedness of the bijection $\ref{quotient-by-equivalence-relation}$. By descent we may just show, that the fibers $\fib_f (f(s))$ for $s : U$ are covering 0-stacks. But by the bijection in \ref{quotient-by-equivalence-relation} those are equivalent to the fibers $R_s$, which are covering 0-stacks as the equivalence relation is covering. \\
	\item [1 $\to$ 2]
	This can be reformulated in the following way, using the recursion principle for (covering) geometric 0-stacks:
	Let $X$ be a sheaf of sets. Let $S$ be (covering-) affine and $f : S \to X$ be fibered in covering algebraic spaces. Then $X$ is a (covering) algebraic space.
%	The identity types of $X$ admit a map fibered in covering algebraic spaces (todo check stability under $\sum$) out of an affine by \ref{lemma:havingAbstractAtlasClosedUnderId}. by \ref{lemma:detectGeomProp} they are geometric propositions. 
This follows from the observation, that the equivalence relation determined by $f$ is covering \ref{def:coveringEqRel} , because the fibers of $f$ are covering 0-stacks.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
	For any $n \ge 1$, we have inclusions 
	\[W_{n} \subset \CS_{n-1} \subset W_{n+1}\]
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	Induction. $n = 1$ gives
	\[
	\mathsf{HasCatlas}_\bT \subset \CS_0 \subset \text{ types admitting a catlas fibered in } W_1
	\]
	the latter inclusion is the previous theorem. \\
	The induction step is obtained by \ref{prop:nstack}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Schemes are algebraic Spaces for the Zariski Topology}
\begin{definition}
 A proposition $U$ is open iff its merely of the form $f_1 \ inv \lor \hdots f_n inv$ for some $f_i : R$.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	Given $f_1, \hdots,f_n : R$ such that $\| D(f_1) + \hdots + D(f_n) \|$ then $\sum_{i=1}^n D(f_i) \in \Zar$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{prop}
	Every Zariski-merely-inhabited type that is merely of the form $U_1 + \hdots + U_n$ for open propositions $U_i$ admits a $\Zar$-catlas.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	By definition of openness, We can choose a surjection $\coprod_{j=1}^{n_i} D(f_{ij}) \twoheadrightarrow U_i$ for any $i$. We want to show, that the map
	\[
	\coprod_{i , j} D(f_{ij}) \twoheadrightarrow U_1 + \hdots U_n
	\]
	is a $\Zar$-catlas. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Let us first show that the fibers are in $\Zar$. Assume $U_i$ holds. So we find a term in $\coprod_j D(f_{ij})$. In particular we have $\| \coprod_j D(f_{ij})\|_{\Zar}$. By the lemma we conclude, that the fiber $\sum_j D(f_{ij})$ belongs to $\Zar$.\\
		\item The total space is in $\Zar$: This follows as the surjection after propositional truncation becomes an equivalence. As we have $\| U_1 + \hdots + U_n\|$, we can conclude by the lemma.
	\end{itemize}
	
\end{proof}
\begin{warning}
	The converse does not hold! We want to apply \ref{lemma:stackificationHasTCover}, to the map
	\[\Zar \ni 1 + 1 \to \sum D(f) \]
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	$\sum D(f)$ is seperated as $D(f)$ is a sheaf.
		\item 	All the fibers are equivalent to $1 + X$, hence they are in the Zariski topology.
	\end{itemize}	
\end{warning}
\begin{lemma}
	let $X$ be a scheme. There merely exists some affine $S$  map $S \to X$ whose fibers are merely inhabited finite sums of open propositions 
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}		
		Every scheme is an algebraic space.
\end{corollary}


\begin{lemma}
	If $X$ is an algebraic space, then the global sections embed via a $R$-algebra homomorphisms into a finitely presented $R$-algebra.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	Choose an atlas $S \to X$, in particular $\bT$-surjective. As $\bT$ is subcanonical the map $R^X \to R^S$ is an injection.
\end{proof}
\begin{question}
	Is it an open embedding of types?
\end{question}
%\begin{lemma}
%	Consider a morphism $X \to Y$ between algebraic spaces such that $R^F$ is finitely presented and the affinizations of the fibers $F \to \Spec R^F$ are open immersions. If $Y$ is a scheme, then $X$ is a scheme.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	Consider the stein factorization
%	\[
%	X = \sum_{y : Y} \fib_f y \to \sum_{y : Y} \Spec R^{\fib_f y} \to Y
%	\]
%	The first map 
%\end{proof}
\subsection{Examples}
The goal of this subsection is to construct algebraic spaces. The first example actually gives us a scheme:
\begin{example}
	Let $p \neq 0$ be a prime. You can let $\mu_p := \Spec(R[X] / (X^p - 1))$ act on $\bA^\times$ via multiplication. Set $\bT= fppf$. Then the $p$.th power map
	
	\[
	pow : \| \bA^\times // \mu_p \|_0^\bT \to \bA^\times
	\]
	is an equivalence.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	 It is an embedding: 
		First note, that $\|\bA^\times // \mu_p \|_0$ is $\bT$-seperated:
		
		as $\mu_p$ act freely on $\bA^\times$, $\bA^\times // \mu_p$ is already a set. Meaning that the identity types of the set-quotient are $\sum_{g: \mu_p} g x =_{\bA^\times} y$ , hence sheaves. \\
		On the other hand the map $\|\bA^\times // \mu_p \|_0 \to \bA^\times$ is an embedding, as for any $x , y : \bA^\times$ the map $(\sum_{g : \mu_p} g x = y) \to (x^p = y^p)$ is an equivalence. 
		\item 	It is $\bT$-surjective, as for any $\lambda : \bA^\times$, we find $S = \Spec R [X] / (X^p - \lambda) \in \bT$ with 
		\[
		S \to \fib_{\bA^\times / \mu_p \to \bA^\times}(\lambda)
		\]
		hence 
		\[
		1 = \|S\|_\bT \to \|\fib_{pow}\|_0^\bT
		\]
	\end{itemize}
	
	
\end{example}


\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:AlmostEverywhere}}
	Let $p : R[X]$ be reguar. If $f : R[X]$ such that $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in D(p)$, then $f = 0$ in $R[X]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	$f$ is in the kernel of the diagonal map
% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMSwwLCJSXlIiXSxbMSwxLCJSXntSIFxcc2V0bWludXMgXFx7MFxcfX0iXSxbMCwwLCJSW1hdIl0sWzAsMSwiUltYXntcXHBtIDF9XSJdLFswLDFdLFsyLDMsIiIsMCx7InN0eWxlIjp7InRhaWwiOnsibmFtZSI6Imhvb2siLCJzaWRlIjoidG9wIn19fV0sWzAsMiwiIiwxLHsibGV2ZWwiOjIsInN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6Im5vbmUifX19XSxbMSwzLCIiLDEseyJsZXZlbCI6Miwic3R5bGUiOnsiaGVhZCI6eyJuYW1lIjoibm9uZSJ9fX1dXQ==
\[\begin{tikzcd}
	{R[X]} & {R^R} \\
	{R[X]_p} & {R^{D(p)}}
	\arrow[hook, from=1-1, to=2-1]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-2, to=1-1]
	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=2-2, to=2-1]
\end{tikzcd}\]
	which is injective, as $p$ is regular. \\
	Thus $f = 0$ in $R[X]$.
%	 Thus $f = 0 $ in $(R \setminus \{0\} \to R) = R[X^{\pm 1}]$ hence $f \cdot X^n = 0$ in $R[X]$ for some $n$, thus $f = 0$.
\end{proof}
Let $\ell \neq 0$ denote a prime. Consider $\mu_\ell = R[X] / (X^\ell - 1)$.
%\[\mu_\ell'  = \Spec R[X] / (X^{p-1} + \hdots + 1) = \mu_\ell \setminus\{1\}\]
 $\mu_\ell$ acts on $R[X]$, via $(g.p)(x) = p(g x)$. 
\begin{lemma}
	Let $p(0) \neq 0$. We say some $\phi: R[X]_p$ is $\ell$-even if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied:
	\begin{enumerate}

	\item The function $\phi : D(p) \to R$ is a $\ell$-even function, i.e. $\phi(x) = \phi(g x)$ for all $ x : D(p)$ and each $g : \mu_\ell$.
	\item The function $\phi|_{D(p) \setminus 0} : D(p) \setminus \{0\} \to R$ is an $\ell$-even function
	\item[1']  There exists $f : R[X], n : \bN$ such that $\phi= f/ p^n$ and $f (g.p)^n (x) = (g.f) p^n (x)$ for each $x : R , g : \mu_\ell$.
	\item[2'] The same as 3. but only for $x : D(p) \setminus\{0\}$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	For any $x : D(p), g : \mu_\ell$ we have 
	\[
	f/p^n (x) = f/p^n(g x)  \leftrightarrow f(x) (g.p)^n (x) = f(gx) p^n x \tag{$\star$}
	\]
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [1' $\Rightarrow$ 1 , 2' $\Leftrightarrow$ 2] Just ($\star$)
		\item [1 $\Rightarrow$ 2] Clear
		\item [1' $\Leftrightarrow$ 2'] We show that for any$ f , n$ $f(x) (g.p)^n (x) = f(gx) p^n x $ holds already everywhere on $R$ if it holds in $D(p) \setminus 0 = D(pX)$. %(we only need on $D(p)$, but we may even show on all of $R$) 
		We may apply \ref{lemma:AlmostEverywhere}, so we have to check that $p X$  is regular. But $X$ is regular and $p(0)$ is regular, thus By lemma 1.3.6 Foundations \todocite $p$ is regular in $R[X]$. hence $p X$ is regular. % But $D(p)$ is inhabited, this corresponds to some $r : R$ such that $p(r) \neq 0$, i.e. regular. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $p : R[X]$ be such that $0 \in D(p)$ and $x \in D(p)$ implies $gx \in D(p)$ for all $g : \mu_\ell$.
	The sheaf-quotient of $D(p)$ by the relation which identifies $x$ and $gx$ when $x \neq 0, g : \mu_\ell \setminus \{1\}$ is an algebraic space, that is not an affine scheme.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The conditions on $p$ give $p(0) \neq 0$ and $p(x) \neq 0 \to p(gx) \neq 0$ for all $g : \mu_\ell$.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Construction of the algebraic space:
	
	Define
	\[
	E(x,y) = (x = y) + (x \neq 0 \land \sum_{g : \mu_\ell \setminus \{1\}} gx = y)
	\]
	This is a proposition: First note, that both summands are propositiosn because $\mu_\ell$ acts freely on $\bA^1 \setminus \{0\}$. If both summands are inhabited we get a contradiction, as $x = y$ and $gx = y$ implies $(g-1) x = y - x = 0$, but as $g-1$ is invertible $x = 0$. \\
	The relation is covering: 
	The propositions are affines, thus sheaves. Furthermore, for any $y : D(p)$ we have
	\[
	\sum_{x : D(p)}  (x = y) + (x \neq 0 \times \sum_{g : \mu_\ell \setminus \{1\}} gx = y) = 1 + (y \neq 0 \times \mu_\ell \setminus \{1\}) \in \bT
	\]
	as $\mu_\ell \setminus \{1\} = \sum_{g : \mu_\ell} g \neq 1$ is a $\sum$ of formally \etale + flat affines (recall that formally \etale affines have decidable equality).

\item 	Lets call this quotient $X$.

Define 
\[
A = \{\phi : R[X]_p \ | \ \phi \text{  is $\ell$-even }\}
\]
This is an $R$-subalgebra: for any $r : R$, $r : R[X]_p$ is $\ell$-even. $\ell$-even functions are stable under addition and multiplication . \\

	Claim: The affinization map of $X$ is the induced dashed map $f : X \to \Spec A$ in
	
% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJEKHApIl0sWzEsMCwiXFxTcGVjIFJbWF1fcCJdLFswLDEsIlgiXSxbMSwxLCJcXFNwZWMgQSJdLFswLDIsInEiXSxbMiwzLCJcXGV4aXN0ISBmIiwwLHsic3R5bGUiOnsiYm9keSI6eyJuYW1lIjoiZGFzaGVkIn19fV0sWzEsM10sWzAsMSwiIiwyLHsibGV2ZWwiOjIsInN0eWxlIjp7ImhlYWQiOnsibmFtZSI6Im5vbmUifX19XV0=

	\arrow[from=1-2, to=2-2]
	\arrow["{\exists! f}", dashed, from=2-1, to=2-2]
\end{tikzcd}\]
	Proof: A function $\phi : D(p) \to R$ factors through $q$ iff $\phi$ is $\ell$-even as in (2). Thus, the embedding (using that $R$ is a sheaf) $R^X \hookrightarrow R^{D(p)} = R[X]_p$ has image $A$. $\qed$(Claim). 	\\ \\ %respective $\phi : R[X]_p$ satisfies $	\phi (x) = \phi(-x)  $, i.e. (1) if $\phi$ is $\ell$-even. 
 Proof that $X$ is not an affine:	Assume that $X$ were affine. Then the map $f$ would be in particular an embedding. 
	As we want to prove a contradiction we may assume a root $g : \Spec R[X] / (\sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} X^i)$. Using that $\sum_{i=0}^{\ell-1} X^i | X^\ell -1 $ and $\ell \neq 0$, in particular we can view $g$ as a term in $\mu_\ell \setminus \{1\}$. Then for any $\varepsilon : \Spec R[X] / X^\ell \subset D(p)$ (using that invertibility is $\lnot \lnot$ stable) we have
	\begin{align*}
	(q\varepsilon =_X q (g \varepsilon)) \overset{\ref{quotient-by-equivalence-relation}}{=} (\varepsilon = g\varepsilon) + (\varepsilon \neq 0 \land \sum_{h \neq 1} \varepsilon = h g \varepsilon) = ((g-1)\varepsilon = 0) = (\varepsilon = 0)
	\end{align*}
	But it always holds $\varepsilon =_{\Spec A} g \varepsilon$, as for any $\phi : A$ we have $\phi(\varepsilon) = \phi(g \varepsilon)$ as $\phi$ satisfies the condition (1). \\
	So we conclude the the embedding $\{0\} \hookrightarrow \Spec R[X] / X^\ell$ is an equivalence. Contradiction to algebra as $R[X] / X^\ell \to R[X] / X$ is not an equivalence.
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}
	Open subtypes of $\bA^1$ are $\lnot \lnot$ principal open. %If the open is inhabited, $\lnot \lnot$ merely we can $\ell$-even write it as $D(p)$ with $p : R[X]$ regular .
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item An open affine subscheme of $\bA^1$ is $\lnot \lnot$ principal open: Let $D(f_1,\hdots,f_n) \subset \bA^1$ be an arbitrary open subset. We may assume that each $f_i : R[X]$ is non constant (in particular non zero). By \todocite, $\lnot \lnot$-merely each $D(f_i) \subset R$ is cofinite. Thus $\lnot \lnot$-merely, the finite union $\bigcup_{i=1}^n D(f_i) \subset R$ is cofinite as well, hence principal open. % we find roots $a_{ij}$ of the $f_i$. $\bigcup_i D(f_i) = \bigcup_i R \setminus \{a_{ij}\}_j = R \setminus \bigcap_{i} \{a_{ij}\}$ for some finite subset. This is $\lnot \lnot$ a principal open. %By $\lnot \lnot $ stability 
	\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\begin{prop}
	Let $\ell \neq 0$ be prime. The sheaf quotient of $\bA^1$ by the relation that identifies each  $x \neq 0$ with $g x$ if $g^p = 1, g \neq 1$ is an algebraic space that is not a scheme.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
	It is an algebraic space by putting $p \equiv 1 : R[X]$ above. \\
	Assume $0$ has an open affine neighborhood $U$. The preimage along the quotient map obtained from the relation induces a open neigbhorhood of $0$ inÂ´ $\bA^1$. As we want to prove a contradiction, we may assume it is a principal open $D(p) \ni 0$. As it saturated wrt to the equivalence relation we have $x \in D(p) \to g x \in D(p)$ for all $x \neq 0, g \in \mu_\ell \setminus \{1\}$. We are in the following situation:
	% https://q.uiver.app/#q=WzAsNCxbMCwwLCJEKHApIl0sWzEsMCwiXFxiQcK5Il0sWzEsMSwiWCJdLFswLDEsIlUiXSxbMCwxLCIiLDAseyJzdHlsZSI6eyJ0YWlsIjp7Im5hbWUiOiJob29rIiwic2lkZSI6InRvcCJ9fX1dLFswLDNdLFszLDIsIiIsMix7InN0eWxlIjp7InRhaWwiOnsibmFtZSI6Imhvb2siLCJzaWRlIjoidG9wIn19fV0sWzEsMl0sWzAsMiwiIiwxLHsic3R5bGUiOnsibmFtZSI6ImNvcm5lci1pbnZlcnNlIn19XV0=

		\arrow[hook, from=2-1, to=2-2]
	\end{tikzcd}\]
	Then we have $D(p) / \sim' \simeq U$ with restricted equivalence relation. Applying the previous lemma to $D(p)$, we see $U$ cannot be affine. Contradiction.
\end{proof}
\begin{example}
	The scheme 
	\[
	\sum_{x , y : R} x y = 0
	\]
	sheaf-quotiented by the relation that identifies $(x,0)$ and $(0,x)$ if $x \neq 0$ is an algebraic space.
\end{example}
\begin{proof}
	The equivalence relation is given by
	\[
	E((x,y) , (x',y')) = (x = x' \land y = y') + (x \neq 0 \land x = y' \land x' = 0)
	\]
	as $x \neq 0$ implies $y = 0$ as $x y =0$. This is a covering relation, as for any $x' y' = 0$ we have
	\[
	\sum_{x,y : R} x y = 0 \land E((x,y) , (x' , y')) = 1 + (y' \neq 0) \in \bT \subset \Zar
	\]		
\end{proof}



\section{Group quotients}
For this section let $G$ denote a group that is a covering 0-stack. Let $X$ be a sheaf equipped with a $G$ action.
\begin{lemma}
	 $\mu_p = \Spec R[X] / (X^p - 1)$ is covering for $p \neq 0$ prime.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	It is fppf + \etale as $X^p - 1$ is monic seperable. TODO
\end{proof}
\begin{definition}
	A $G$ action on $X$ is free, if for all $x , y : X$ the type 
	\[
	\sum_{g: G} g x = y
	\]
	is a proposition. 
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	Let $G$ act freely on a sheaf $X$. Then the relation
	\[
	x , y\mapsto \sum_{g : G} g x = y
	\]
	is a covering equivalence relation on $X$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	All those propositions are modal as $X$ and $G$ are sheaves. For all $x : X$ , the fiber
	\[
	\sum_{y : X} \sum_{g : G} g x = y \simeq \sum_{g : G} \sum_{y: X} g x = y \simeq G
	\]
	is a covering 0-stack by assumption.
\end{proof}
\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:algSpacesStabFreeQuots}}
	%For $n \ge 0$, geometric $(n)$-stacks 
	Algebraic spaces are stable by free quotients of covering group 0-stacks.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The map $ X \to L_T (X / G)$ is fibered in covering 0-stacks, so in particular covering $0$-stacks. As $X$ is a geometric $0$-stack, the quotient is a geometric $0$-stack as well, This follows by the description in \label{prop:nstack}, choosing a geometric atlas of $X$ and postcomposing this to get a geometric atlas of the quotient.
\end{proof}

%\begin{lemma}
%	Let $X$ be a geometric stack, whose identity types are covering stacks. Let $G$ be a finite group acting on $X$. Then $L_\bT (X / G)$ is a geometric stack.
%\end{lemma}
%\begin{proof}
%	Consider for $x , y : X$ , $R(x,y) \equiv \| \sum_{g : G} g x = y\|_\bT$ which is indeed modal. We have to check that the relation is covering, i.e. that for all $x : X$, 
%	\[
%	\sum_{y: X} \|\sum_{g: G} g x = y\|_\bT
%	\]
%	is a covering stack. \\
%	To prove this, as covering stacks are stable under quotients, it suffices to show, that the map
%	\[
%	G \simeq \left (\sum_{y : X} \sum_{g : G} g x = y \right) \to \sum_{y: X} \|\sum_{g: G} g x = y\|_\bT
%	\]
%	is a geometric cover. But the fibers look like $\sum_{g : G} gx  = y$ which is a finite sum of identity types in $X$, which were assumed to be covering stacks. By \ref{lemma:geomStackPlusStable} the fibers are covering stacks.
%	
%\end{proof}
