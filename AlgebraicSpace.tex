\section{Algebraic Space}
We first need to define a notion of algebraic space and smooth algebraic space, which should be the smallest class of types that satisfies the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stability under finite limits \ref{thm:stabSums} 
	\item has Descent
	\item (nice) Schemes are contained in it
	\item affines in $\bT$ are smooth algebraic spaces.  (there are probably more). %If $\bT \ni \Spec A \to X$ is a $\bT$-cover and $X$ is a $\bT \Set$, then $X$ is a smooth algebraic space
	\item stable under smooth quotients: If $X$ is an algebraic space, $Y$ modal 0-type and $X \to Y$ is $\bT$-surjective and fibered in smooth algebraic spaces, then $Y$ is an algebraic space. Additionally, if $X$ is smooth, then $Y$ is smooth.
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}
	An affine Scheme $U$ is called flat, if 
	\[\|U\|_\bT \to (U \in \bT)\]	
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}{\label{lemma:flatEquiv}}
	The converse holds always
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	 because things in $\bT$ are automatically $\bT$-merely inhabited
\end{proof}
Recall the definition of $\bT$-atlas \ref{def:TAtlas}
\begin{definition}{\label{def:algprop}}
	We call a modal proposition algebraic, if one of the equivalent conditions is satisfied:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item  its merely of the form $\|U\|_\bT$ for some flat affine $U$.
		\item There is a $\bT$-surjective map out of a flat affine $U$.
		\item It has a $\bT$-atlas.
	\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}
\begin{proof} \
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [1 $\Leftrightarrow$ 2]
		Clear.
		\item [1 $\Rightarrow$ 3]
			we show that $U \to \|U\|_\bT$ is a $\bT$-atlas. Every fiber is in $\bT$, because $U$ is flat.
		\item [3 $\Rightarrow$ 1]
		
				Let $V \to P$ be a $\bT$-atlas.
		have to show TFAE $\|V\|_\bT \to P \to (V \in \bT) \overset{\ref{lemma:flatEquiv}}{\to} \|V\|_\bT$. 
		Proof: $\|V\|_\bT \to P$ as $P$ is modal prop. Secondly, because $V \to P$ is a $\bT$-cover. \\
		Hence $P$ is an algebraic proposition.	
	\end{enumerate}

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
	Algebraic propositions are algebraic spaces.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We have $U \to \|U\|_\bT$ where $U$ is affine, hence an algebraic space and the fibers are in $\bT$ by flatness of $U$, hence they are smooth algebraic spaces. By stability under quotients, our algebraic proposition is an algebraic space.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	An smooth equivalence relation on a set $U$ is some equivalence relation $R : U^2 \to \Prop$, whose fibers are in $\bT$
\end{definition}
\begin{lemma}
	let $U$ be an algebraic space (e.g. affine scheme) and $R : U^2 \to \Prop$ be a smooth equivalence relation %, whose fibers are in $\bT$. 
	Then $U / R$ is an algebraic space
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The map $U \to U / R$ is fibered in $\bT$, in particular fibered in smooth algebraic spaces.% As $U$ is affine, its an algebraic space. 
	By stability under smooth quotients, $U / R$ is an algebraic space.
\end{proof}



\begin{corollary}
	Let $U$ be affine and $R$ a smooth equivalence relation. The identity types of $U / R$, i.e. the propositions $R(x,y)$, are algebraic propositions. %		In our setting, 	From the previous lemma we find a $\bT$-atlas $V \to P$ , t
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	By \ref{lemma:havingAbstractAtlasClosedUnderId}, the class of types admitting a $\bT$-atlas is closed under taking identity types. 	$U / R$ is a type admitting a $\bT$-atlas, hence its identity types admit them as well.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	A modal set $X$ is a classical algebraic space iff it is merely of the form $U / R$ for some affine $U$ and  $R : U^2 \to \Prop$ a smooth equivalence relation. Equivalently there exists some $\bT$-atlas $U \to X$ (i.e. out of an affine). We call $X$ smooth if $U$ can be choosen to be in $\bT$.
\end{definition}
\begin{corollary}[of \ref{def:algprop}]
	Classical Algebraic spaces that are propositions are algebraic propositions.
\end{corollary}

\begin{rmk}
	Assume Saturatedness of the topology. smooth classical Algebraic spaces which are affine are in $\bT$.
\end{rmk}
\begin{question}
Is the class of classical algebraic spaces stable under smooth quotients? If its not, how should we enlarge it?
\end{question}
Try:
Assume $R$ is fibered in smooth algebraic spaces. Choose $U \to T$ a $\bT$-atlas. For any $x : U$ the fiber $R_x$ merely has an atlas $\tilde R_x \to R_x$. As $U$ has choice (its affine), we find some $\bT$-cover $ \tilde U = \sum_x \tilde R_x \to \sum_x R_x$. 
Goal: Find for all $t : U / R$ a $\bT$-atlas $V_t \to \fib_{[]}(t)$. Then $\sum_t V_t$ will be affine, because its the total space of a $\bT$-cover of an affine. Moreover, $\sum_t V_t \to \sum_t \fib_{[]}(t) \to U/R$ will be a $\bT$-cover, as $V_t \in \bT$. This is what we wanted to show.
%Define the respective equivalence relation $\tilde R$, such that we get $\tilde U / \tilde R \to U \to U / R$ with $\tilde U / tilde R. As $U$ is affine

% with affine target, hence the domain is affine as well.
